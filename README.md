# API subs for asbplayer

Web app: https://zakwarsame.github.io/asbplayer/

This is a fork of [asbplayer](https://github.com/killergerbah/asbplayer) that adds automatic subtitle search and download functionality for anime sites. It works with the [Jimaku API](https://jimaku.cc/login) and [Anilist API](https://anilist.co/docs/api) to automatically detect anime titles and episodes on supported streaming sites.

## How it Works

The extension:

1. Detects when you're on a supported anime site
2. Extracts the anime title and episode number
3. Uses the Anilist API to find the correct anime ID
4. Searches for subtitles using the Jimaku API
5. Loads the subtitles directly into asbplayer

## Contributing

To add support for additional anime sites:

1. Add the site configuration to `animeSites` in `extension/src/services/anime-sites.ts`
2. Define the title and episode selectors for the site
3. Submit a pull request
